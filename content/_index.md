Namaste! I'm Ishwor Ghimire — a passionate Travel and Tourism Management student at the Nepal Academy of Tourism and Hotel Management (NATHM). I’m enthusiastic about exploring the world, sharing stories, and making meaningful contributions to the travel and tourism industry.

With a strong academic foundation and practical experience, I’ve taken on roles such as Assistant Coordinator (intern) where I managed administrative tasks and supported large groups of students. I’ve also worked on content creation for a travel company, blending creativity with industry insight.

I’m always eager to learn and grow. Volunteering at several international level events—like “Accelerating Foundational Learning: Going to Scale in South Asia” organized by the World Bank, UNICEF, and the Government of Nepal—has enriched my perspective and deepened my commitment to global engagement.

On this site, you’ll find my travel stories, creative projects, insights into my journey as a future tourism professional or any interesting thing that I want to share. I love blogging, making videos, and staying up to date with the latest in tech and travel.

Thanks for stopping by, I hope you enjoy exploring my work!
